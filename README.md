# NicoCourts.com Administrator Interface

Originally I was trying to do the adminstrator interface all in Angular, but it ends up that TypeScript is really just not suited to the kind of computing I wanted to do.

Thus I went to the old standby -- Python. I plan on developing the GUI using GTK+ so that I can use it on my computers.

Eventually I would like to create an android app so I can edit things and post from my phone. Heck, might as well use Java so I can incorporate four different languages into this thing!
