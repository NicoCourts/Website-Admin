# NicoCourts.com Administrator Interface

Originally I was trying to do the adminstrator interface all in Angular, but it ends up that TypeScript is really just not suited to the kind of computing I wanted to do.

Thus I went to the old standby -- Python. I plan on developing the GUI using GTK+ so that I can use it on my computers. The only problem is I've never written an application for the desktop before so there's a bit of a learning curve. At the moment my code is ridiculuously monolithic and scattered with code that does nothing as I try to navigate the `PyGObject` library.

As the functionality gets closer to what I want I will continually refactor until it becomes more legible and neater.
