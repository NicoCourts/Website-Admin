# NicoCourts.com Administrator Interface

This interface for composing blogs went through several iterations before arriving at this final form. I have tried writing this using many different languages before realizing that Electron was really the right framework to use. I can use my CSS skills to control the appearance and Typescript to control all the interactions.

I am considering this project done at this point because it "just works". At some point in the future I will want to revisit the design to make it slightly less clunky.

## To-dos
1. Incorporate the different windows into a single window so things don't feel as cluttered.
1. Polish the flow for common tasks (make composition a priority).
1. Squash bugs as they arise.
